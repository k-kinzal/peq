A CLI tool that analyzes PHP code dependencies and visualizes the blast radius of changes. Provides tree output for humans, enabling safe modification of PHP code by understanding what breaks when a class, method, or function changes.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher

## Installation

Download the PHAR from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/k-kinzal/peq/releases):

```bash
curl -Lo peq.phar https://github.com/k-kinzal/peq/releases/latest/download/peq.phar
chmod +x peq.phar
sudo mv peq.phar /usr/local/bin/peq
```

Or install via Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev k-kinzal/peq
```

## Usage

```
Description:
  Show dependency tree of a PHP function/method/class.

Usage:
  peq [options] [--] <target> [<path>]

Arguments:
  target                     Namespace\ClassName, Namespace\ClassName::methodName or Namespace\functionName
  path                       Base directory to analyze (default: current working dir)

Options:
      --config=CONFIG        Path to config file (default: <cwd>/.peq.yaml)
  -D, --direction=DIRECTION  Dependency direction: uses|used-by (default: uses)
  -R, --reverse              Shortcut for --direction used-by
  -L, --level=LEVEL          Limit depth of the dependency graph
  -I, --include=INCLUDE      Include patterns (multiple values allowed)
  -E, --exclude=EXCLUDE      Exclude patterns (multiple values allowed)
      --type=TYPE            Analyzer type (phpstan|native|debug)
      --memory-limit=MEMORY-LIMIT  Memory limit (e.g. 1G, 256M)
  -h, --help                 Display help for the given command
  -V, --version              Display this application version
```

## Analyzers

Two analyzers read real sources, and they are built to describe the same graph:

| `--type`  | What it does | Where it is available |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|
| `phpstan` | Runs PHPStan over the sources and assembles the graph from what its collectors report. The reference engine. | Installed from source or via Composer |
| `native`  | Reads the sources directly with a parser, resolving names the way PHP does. Between 13x and 59x faster. | Everywhere, including the released PHAR |

```bash
peq 'App\Domain\Invoice::total' src --type=native
```

**The released PHAR carries only `native`.** Bundling a static analyser to run a parser
is most of the download for none of the answers: the PHAR is 7.2MB where PHPStan alone
is 47MB. `--type` there offers `native|debug` and refuses anything else — the choice a
build can make is the choice it is asked to make. Installed from source or via Composer,
`--type=phpstan` is there and remains the default.

The two are not asked to agree by inspection. `native` is checked against `phpstan` by
comparing the graphs they build of the same sources, reduced to a canonical form: a
corpus of scenarios written to exercise every kind of symbol and relation the graph
model has, peq's own sources, and programs drawn at random by a property test that
shrinks any disagreement to the one expression that causes it.

Every one of those checks runs in CI. A further job reads **every installed dependency**
with both engines and fails on any difference, so a package that arrives tomorrow is read
tomorrow:

```bash
composer test:equivalence
```

Two differences remain, both of them places where the reference engine has no answer
to agree with:

- A file PHP itself would refuse is left out by both engines, silently.
- A `class` declared inside a method body makes PHPStan raise an internal error, which
  peq reports as a failed analysis; `native` reads it.

## Configuration

Create a `.peq.yaml` file in your project root to set default options:

```yaml
type: native
excludes:
  - vendor
  - vendor-bin
  - .git
  - tests
```

Configuration is resolved by merging 4 layers (later layers override earlier ones):

1. Default values
2. Environment variables (`PEQ_*`)
3. YAML config file (`.peq.yaml`)
4. CLI options
